				<div class="links">
					<p>
						Ruby is an awesomely object oriented language.  This means it has both Classes and Objects. Objects are each of the actual
things your program creates and uses.  You create an array called Danny, that is an object of the type array.  Classes act as the 'blueprint' for creating these objects.  Classes tell what each object is made up of and how it should be initialized.  The unique data inside each individual object is stored in variables called 'instance variables'.  If you have skateboard object it will be made up of a few pieces - wheels, trucks, and a deck.  Every skateboard has these defined in their Class as instance variables.
Each individual skateboard I own has different values for these instance variables - some have green wheels while others have blue.  Finally, the Class also includes methods that tell what the object the Class is creating can do.  For instance my skateboard Class might have a move-forward method.  Since it is defined in the Class, every individual skateboard object that is created has the move-forward method and can use it.
