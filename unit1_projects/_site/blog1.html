	<h1 align="center">Week 1 Part 4: Favorite Websites</h1>
	<p>Wireframes I created for the following sites can be found <a href="wireframe_sites.html">here</a>.</p>
	<h3>Website 1: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" target="_blank">The New York Times</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The NY Times has always been one of my favorite websites.  When I am using my computer and need a break from what I am working on or am simply bored my first reaction is to open a new tab with nytimes.com.  It's almost muscle memory at this point.  I really like this site's clean design and layout.  I've always liked sites that are simplistic and elegent, and the content is always great.  My eyes are immediately drawn to the logo in the header and the main story's large centered picture on the homepage.  Stepping back reveals this main story is the most important part of the homepage. The website is clean, uncluttered, elegent, classic, and bright.  This website solves the problem of delivering news quickly without clutter or cumbersome ads.  It serves mainly text content of news storys with some accompanying photos.  The content is informative, practical, simplistic, serious, and reliable.  The content and the site's visual layout share the descriptions of clean, simple, and to the point.  I often am not looking for anything specific while on the homepage but it is generally easy to find the different sections I might be interested, such as op-eds or politics.  It is always easy to find your way around from other pages, this is due to the substantial header that is used throughout the site.  Browsing articles throughout the site is extremely easy and the site's simplicity can be thanked for this.  I really like how the main content of the homepage is centered with a large padding on the left and right.  This centering focuses your attention and helps give the site its clean feel with lots of bright white surrounding the main content area. Spending large amounts of time on NY Times never feels like a waste because the content is so informative.  I almost always leave the site knowing something I didn't before I browsed.  The site sells subscriptions that are required to view more than 10 articles per month.  Luckily my University provides me with a free account so I haven't had to purchase a paid subscription yet.

	<h3>Website 2: <a href="http://www.hypem.com" target="_blank">The Hype Machine</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			I almost always have a tab open with The Hype Machine if I am on my computer.  The Hype Machine is a music aggrogator that pulls all the newest music from blogs across the internet and presents them in order of popularity.  The content of this site is what makes it one of my favorite but the layout and user design make it a pleasure to use and definitely keep me coming back. When looking at the homepage my eyes are immediately drawn to the bright header and bright ads on the right hand side of the page.  This is still true when I take a few steps back. I wouldn't say these are the most important areas of the site but they do fram the main body well. Visually the hype machine can be described as clean, bright, fun, modern, and young.  The problem this site serves is to serve up the freshest music that people are enjoying across the web.  The content is purely audio and is presented by songs in the main portion of the page, each with album art, a short blurb, and a large play button.  The content can be described as fresh, fun, loud, upbeat, and interesting.  It is really easy to find your way around any of the pages on the hype machine, including the homepage.  Again a substantial header navigation helps moving around the site really easy and the search functionality makes finding particular songs a breeze.  The main content of the site is the songs and it is really easy to browse through them, especially with sorting functions such as by popularity or by date.  I almost always have the site running in the background playing the top music choices so I always feel good after spending a while on the site.  The Hype Machine does not sell anything directly but the ads I mentioned earlier are for albums, however I have never purchased an album as a result of the advertising.

	<h3>Website 3: <a href="http://www.fancy.com" target="_blank">Fancy</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			My third and final favorite site is Fancy dot com.  Fancy displays and sells cutting edge products that are aggrigated from blogs across the internet.  Most products fall under the categories of home, furniture, clothing, or gadgets.  Again the clean, minimalistic design of this site is what makes it one of my favorites.  When looking at the homepage my eyes are immediatley drawn to the huge images of products that are centered and go down the page.  This is definitely the main and most important part of the site.  Visually the website is clean, minimalistic, bright, simple, and balanced.  The problem the website solves is presenting amazing products that I don't find anywhere else on the web.  The content is mainly large pictures of these products with a caption that includes the product name, price, and link.  The content is interesting, modern, engaging, new, and sophisticated.  It is quite easy to find what I am looking for from the homepage, I generally just scroll down from the top to see what is new since the last time I visited the page.  The header is solid and includes a search funtionality to find specific items.  Browsing the sites content couldn't be easiser, you simply scroll down and javascript makes the page seem to go on forever, no need to click next page to see more content.  After being on the site for a while I don't feel bored but I do feel like I could be using my time more productively.  I often visit Fancy when I need a mental break from what I am working on or don't have anything better to do at that moment.  The site sells almost all the products it displays but I have only ever bought one or two items (the items are generally pretty expensive).  I did buy a pretty awesome world map that is hanging on my wall currently.
