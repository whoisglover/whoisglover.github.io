    <question1>
        <p class="question">Together, discuss and describe why you think pair-programming is important to DBC. 
        Introduce the concept and explain why it's important on your site.</p>
        <p class="answer">Generate fresh, new ideas. It is easy to get stuck in a particular mindset. 
        Fresh pair of eyes can help break out of that. Pairing also helps getting to know each other.</p>
    </question1>
    <question2>
        <p class="question"> Discuss what pairing means and explain what driver and navigator mean. You will want to compare these on the website.</p>
        <p class="answer"> Working collaboratively to solve a problem (software dev problems in our case). Sharing knowledge to solve a problem.
                    The driver is responsible for the typing, with selective input. The navigator gives the high-level direction. 
                    It is important that the benefits of driver vs navigator does not conflict with those of peer-pairing.
        </p>
    </question2>
    <question3>
        <p class="question">What was it like to pair for the first time? Did you enjoy it?
        What worked? What didn't work? Add that to your page and style it as well.</p>
        <p class="answer">We both thought this pairing had real value and was beneficial to our learning.  Austin stated that pairing so far has helped him stay on task and focused, Danny (typing) agrees.
        We both enjoyed the pairing and Greg's leading questions and guidance helped a lot. </p>
