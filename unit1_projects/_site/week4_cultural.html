						A major source of conflict when I return home to stay with my parents is driving.  It is always great to be back and spend time with my family, but it seems like as soon as we get in the car together we begin to argue. I am usually behind the wheel.  It feels like I am doing my parents a favor when I drive them, and I really enjoy driving anyways.  This is where the conflict comes in. Both my parents correct my driving continuously and loudly.  After researching conflict resolution I have realized this is truly a problem of conflicting perceptions.  When I am behind the wheel and can feel the car I understand what the appropriate speed is, or when to start applying the brakes.  However, when you are in the passenger seat you feel helpless with no way to influence the car, and worse no way to know what the driver is thinking.  I don't usually take their perception into account and the drive turns into a yelling match with my mom or dad explaining that I'm going to get someone killed and me ranting about an impecable driving record. The easy fix here is to let them drive all the time.  But I think the right thing to do is take their perception into account while I am behind the wheel, and respectfully ask them to consider mine (as well as my perfect driving history).  I think a civilized conversation outside of the car could and will go a long way.
