			<li><h3>Exercise 1:</h3>
				<b>When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</b></li>
				<p>The following values come to mind: Courage, Challenge, Leadership, Competence</p>
			<li><h3>Exercise 2:</h3>
				<b>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</b></li>
				<p>Leadership is a very important value to me.  I find I am happiest when I am leading effectively and when others feel they can rely on me for sound leadership.  I am not frightened by the idea of a greater responsibility that comes with leading a team and I think I work best while leading.  I don't think I am all knowing or always right when leading, instead I really like working to make sure everyone on my team feels they play an equally significant role as everyone else.</p>
			<li><h3>Exercise 3:</h3>

				In general, I try to live up to these values:

			<li><h3>Exercise 4:</h3>
				<b>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</b></li>
				<p>The last topic someone asked me for advice on, and the most common topic I am asked for advice on, was technology.  I am often troubleshooting my families various technology issues from iPhones not working properly to which types of technology to invest in.</p>
