						SQL injection is a terrible beast you never want to deal with while managing a piece of software.  Good news! From what I have found so far it is entirely avoidable.  But first, what is SQL injection?  It is a way for hackers or malicious users to attack your app’s database by entering SQL queries in places that your websites take text such as input forms.  If done successfully (and if the site is vulnerable) an SQL injection attack could wipe your entire database before you can say sani-what?  That’s where sanitizing input comes in.  Before the user’s text input is processed it must be filtered for escape characters.  This text is then sent a long and put in to a regular SQL statement to return data or put the forms data into the database.  If these escape characters are allowed to get in then the malicious user could pass whatever they want to the statement.  One major example of this is passing ‘1’==‘1’ for an authentication check.  Since this is always true the user just got around your real check.  Or the user could send along a drop table statement which would delete your entire table without warning.  Simply checking the input for any escape characters and replacing them with things that don’t have special meaning in SQL can avoid this headache.   Lastly, not type checking input can also let a nefarious user send in SQL statements.  The example here is an input box that is looking for an integer number.  If the input is not checked to be an integer then text could be sent, and this text could contain the SQL injection.  Moral of the story: take the time to sanitize/check any and all input on your site!
