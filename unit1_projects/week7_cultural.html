				<div class="links">
					<p>
						My values from week 1 were: Courage, Challenge, Leadership, Competence.  I stand by these values and still think they are the most important to me.  I also think that they can greatly help me mediate stereotype threats.  I believe greatly in leading by example.  I hope to apply an open minded, caring attitude to DBC and my future work place to create an inviting environment where people don’t feel judged by any stereotypes.  I think it will take leadership and courage to confront those around me that are enforcing stereotypes or judging people for stereotypes.  As far as exercises for when I am feeling down: I plan on reading ‘Happiness is a Habit’ throughout the summer and I hope I can pick up some healthy habits for improving my mood in times of stress or sadness.
