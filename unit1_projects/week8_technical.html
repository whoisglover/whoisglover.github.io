						Recursion is something I have known about for a little while, but it never ceases to amaze me every time I look deeper.  The way I think of recursion in my mind is a rabbit hole.  It can go deeper and deeper but eventually you start making your way back to the surface.  Recursive programs call themselves, but usually with some different parameter than before.  The recursive programs I have built involve a test at the very start, for example does the input parameter y = x? If so you are done, but if not you need to dive deeper into the rabbit hole. When you dive deeper you run whatever code the program or method has before calling the program again with that modified input. Programaticly the Fibonacci sequence is a perfect example of this.  Take the input, check if it is the ‘base case’ or equal to 1.  If it is then return it, but if not dive deeper and call the program with the input -1 plus the input -2.  Eventually you will hit the bottom of the rabbit hole (input is equal to 1) and everything starts traversing its way back up.  Once it hits the top it returns all the added up numbers.  There is much more to be said on the subject of recursion, it is one of the most powerful tools in modern programming.  I hope to update this blog with interesting examples of recursion I learn this summer. test test
