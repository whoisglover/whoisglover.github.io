						After watching Shereef's fireside chat my opinion on what to expect from DBC has changed quite a bit (in a good way!).  I think at first it seemed natural to think there was a huge amount of organization, some master puppeteer was pulling all the strings, and everything had to be exact when I turned in my weekly assignments.  Shereef's video made it clear that DBC is much less structured than this.  I think this is a good thing especially when he explains that we shouldn't look at DBC as a product or a really specific thing that we are doing just to add to our resume.  Instead it is much messier than that, students are guiding their own education, teachers are learning too, and everything is collaborative.  I'm really excited about this aspect of DBC because it means that our fate is much more our own than I originally thought.  It is up to each student to really embrace the culture and take their learning as far as they want, there are no limits.  This freedom of learning will also require great discipline, if I fail I will have no one to blame but myself.  It is our time now and I cannot wait to start DBC next week!
