So far it has been really rewarding to pair with my future peers at DBC.  The first rewarding aspect was simply getting to know them better.  Everyone is really excited about this change in their life and it really shows in pairing sessions.  All the people I've worked with have been excited about getting to know me and see how I'm doing, it's really refreshing.  In terms of solving the challenges I have really liked the seperation of roles.  I've been trying to stick to really having each of us say what we think the roles are as well as switching at almost exactly half way through.  Following these two rules provides an awesome environment of teaching and learning for both people throughout the pairing.  As they say the best way to learn something new is to teach it and I've really enjoyed sharing some of the tips and tricks I've picked up while studying computer science.  I haven't had any really difficult or frustrating pairing situations yet.</li>

It felt very gratifying to read my feedback.  Like I said earlier all my pairing sessions have been really positive and it was nice to see that my pairing partners also had a positive experience.  The feedback I've received has been helpful and given me some good ideas on how to pair better.  Specifically I want to slow down a bit and check in with my partner more to make sure they are on the same page I am.  I also enjoyed writing feedback but in these first few weeks it has been hard to find a lot of actionable things to suggest for my partner.  Overall I think pairing and feedback has really helped my learning experience in phase 0. I'm sure as challenges get longer and harder feedback will become both easier to write and be even more important to improving how I code. I can't wait to have a full page of feedback to read!</li></ul>
