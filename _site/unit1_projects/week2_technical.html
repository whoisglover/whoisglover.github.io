						To learn the difference of in-line elements and in-line blocks first you should know about in-line elements vs block elements. Block elements create a new line, while in line elements do not. Although there is definitely more to the two elements than this fact, the difference between adding a new line or not greatly affects the design and layout of your elements.  Further research taught me that block elements are actually created to hold other elements.  For instance this text is held inside of a &ltp&gt tag.  This detail also greatly helps with designing your page.  It is good to think about elements as a hierarchy.  When adding an element ask yourself is this element going to hold other elements and objects? If not is it being held by a parent element?  In contrast in-line elements can be compared more directly to plain text.  An inline element is just another element that takes up space on the page and flows like text.  This difference is clear when applying CSS styling.  Also block objects naturually expand to fit whatever they contain.  This means they respect left, right, top, and bottom margins and padding.  In contrast, in-line elements only respect left and right but not top and bottom.	Finally, an inline-block element is placed like an in-line element (on the same line as things around it) but behaves like a block element in terms of respecting margins/padding on all sides.  However in-line block elements do not force a new line like block elements do.
