				<div class="links">
					<p>
						Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) seem to be opposite paradigms that can both be useful at different times.  OOP declares almost everything as objects and methods that act on those objects.  You can create more instances of defined objects if you need them, and inheriting functionality from parent objects is very common and useful.  Most of OOP is creating these objects and then having them interact with each other.  My favorite OOP analogy is that of a car.  You define the car class which includes all the pieces of the car you need (instance variables).  Then you define what the car is capable of doing (class methods).  Finally you instantiate as many cars as you want in your program and you have the opportunity to make each one a little different depending on the instantiation.  Functional programming has much less choice.  FP programs are almost entirely made up of mathematical functions. Objects donâ€™t exist.  The goal is to run these mathematical functions on input you supply the program and do something with the output (analyze it, print it, etc).  The lack of choice comes in to play with the functions themselves.  They never change, hence are immutable, which means that if you give the same input to a function today it will spit out the exact same result as it would if you waited a day and gave it the same input.  I like to imagine this as a robot that has canned answers to questions.  Maybe similar to Siri.  If you ask Siri how she is doing she will say the same thing every time (maybe mix it up between two or three answers but for this example we will say she says exactly the same thing every time).  FP is also very useful when you need there to be no ambiguity in what your program might do.					</p>
