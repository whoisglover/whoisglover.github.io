				<p id="title">The Ultimate Scripting Language</p>
				<div class="links">
					<p>
						Why has Javascript claimed the throne as the king of web scripting languages?
						<ul>
						<li>The first and most obvious answer is ease of use.  The learning curve isn't very high with javascript, new programmers can learn it quickly while advanced programmers can easily jump into the more powerful features.  Since it is run on the web there is no need to compile, making it as easy as writing HTML or CSS. </li>

						<li>So its easy, but what can it do? Javascript takes your boring html page from simply displaying information to a full fledged website with user interaction.  The most common uses for javascript include log in systems, form autocompleting, drop down menus, interactive graphics, and much more.</li>

						<li>Finally, front end Javascript is entirely client side.  This means that none of these awesomely interactive features are clogging up your server.   Also Javascript is universally supported on every browser so you can develop your page once and be confident it will work across the board. </li>
