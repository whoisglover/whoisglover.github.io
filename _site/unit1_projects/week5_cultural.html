Some investors think the answer is yes.  One symptom they point to is start-up companies with little or no revenue
being bought for billions of dollars or going public.  Another sign is huge growth rates in some companies.  The problem 
with all this if it is true is of course how far can the bubble inflate before it bursts?  About 15 years ago, right around 1999 and 2000, we saw a similar environment as billions of dollars were pumped into internet start ups.  These start ups 
weren't hardly worth what they were being bought for, but overzealous investors and techies explained that the internet
was changing everything and therefore this really wasn't a bubble.  The internet did change everything, but it wasn't able to
give value to these companies that didn't deserve it and at the turn of the millennium the dot com music began to stop playing. The Nasdaq (largely tech index) fell thousands of points and hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost.  This wasn't just a problem for Silicon Valley.  The national economy was dragged down with the valley and recession followed.  I've found some interesting advice across the web about how to avoid another bubble.  One tip I found was to look for monopolies.  Companies that can grab huge market share may actually be worth their huge price tags.  For example, you go to facebook because that is where your friends are or you use an iPhone because everyone around you is and you want to iMessage with them.  I think this is a good strategy.  Another interesting tip was to look for the 'greediest entrepreneurs'.  This means avoid businesses where the founders are trying to cash out early and instead look for the ones that are only selling stock when they really need to.  This means they believe in the companies future and are in for the long haul.  There is much more research I need to and will be doing on this topic but I hope this gave a quick and interesting insight into the potential tech bubble!					</p>
