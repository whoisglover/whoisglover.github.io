		<h1>Plan</h1>
		<p align="left">I don't feel very confident in my artistic and design skills so before starting this plan I spent some time viewing the webpages that won design awards last year.  I realized I really like simplistic sites with high definition images.  I also like soft colors and sites that have a consistent color scheme.  So with these principles in mind I've created a plan to redesign my index page.  I will use a high-def background image that will take up the entire page.  I will use CSS properties to make sure the image is always centered and does not scroll. Next I will create two boxes on the left and right side of the page.  The left will hold my name and a description of the site, while the right box will hold the main content of the pag, which will be links to Phase 0 projects.  I saw this kind of split on a vacation website that won a design award and I really liked how it looked.  I'm not sure if I will be using absolute or relative positioning for these boxes, but I will decide which looks and feels better when I'm actually building it.  Below is a wireframe of my idea.</p>
